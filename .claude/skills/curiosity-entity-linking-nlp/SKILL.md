description: How entity recognition and linking work in a Curiosity workspace — spotters built from node fields, index-linking rules that write _Mentions/_AppearsIn edges, NLP pipelines, and which fields deserve which. Use when deciding what should be found inside free text, when mentions are not appearing, or when configuring the NLP layer of a new use case.

# Entity linking — turning prose into edges

The connector writes the relationships the **source states**. This layer writes the
relationships the **text implies**. Between them they are the whole retrieval story, and the
demo only lands if the second layer finds things the first could not.

Everything here lives in the workspace definitions (`nlp/spotters/`, `nlp/linking/`,
`nlp/pipelines/`) and is version-controlled with the rest of the workspace — see
`curiosity-workspace-configuration`.

## 1. The three pieces

```
        ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
        │ SPOTTER                                 │  "these strings exist"
        │ built from a node type + field:         │  every PartNumber.Pn value
        │ every value of that field becomes a     │  becomes findable in text
        │ term the tokenizer can spot             │
        └────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                         │ referenced by
        ┌────────────────▼────────────────────────┐
        │ PIPELINE                                │  "run these spotters"
        │ an ordered set of models/spotters, per  │
        │ language, that text is parsed through   │
        └────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                         │ consumed by
        ┌────────────────▼────────────────────────┐
        │ LINKING RULE                            │  "when spotted in THIS
        │ (entity type, entity node type,         │   field of THIS node type,
        │  data node type, data field,            │   write THESE edges"
        │  edge to entity, edge to node)          │
        └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                         │
                         ▼
                _Mentions  /  _AppearsIn
```

**A spotter alone does nothing visible.** It makes a term recognisable; the linking rule is
what turns a recognised term into an edge. Both must exist, and the field must be indexed.

---

## 2. Spotters — one per (node type, field)

A spotter built from a node field takes every value of that field across the graph and makes
it spottable in text. The file is an `_NlpSpotterFromNode` (`nlp/spotters/<Type>.<Field>.<uid>.json`);
start from an exported one — the importer reads `NodeType` / `FieldName`, and a file in any
other shape (`Name`, `BuiltFrom`) is not a spotter. Configuration that matters:

| Setting | What it decides | How to choose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NodeType` / `FieldName` | which values become terms | the field holding the identifier, not the title |
| `IgnoreCase` | case-insensitive matching | `true` for names, usually `true` for identifiers too |
| `IgnoreNumbers` | whether a purely numeric token can match | **`true` for identifiers that are alphanumeric-with-structure; `false` for identifiers made of digits and separators** |
| `MinimumLength` | shortest string that may match | raise it until short values stop producing noise — 5 is a sane floor |
| `IncludeAlias` | also spot known aliases of the node | `true` |
| `Exceptions` | nodes never to spot | the false-friend list; grows in tuning. **UIDs of the excluded nodes, not their values** — a value there fails the import with `Invalid UID128 input` |
| `IgnoreDates` | whether a date-shaped token can match | **required since 26.10** — a spotter file without it fails with `Value cannot be null (Parameter 'value')`. `false` unless the identifiers look like dates |

Two rules learned the hard way:

- **Only build a spotter where there is a master list.** The whole value of this mechanism is
  that a spotted term resolves to *a node that exists*. Without a catalogue, you are matching
  a pattern and inventing entities.
- **Never let the spotter create nodes.** Linking rules take an `AddIfNotFound` flag; keep it
  `false`. A mention that resolves to nothing should stay plain text. Turning it on fills the
  graph with typo-nodes that then poison facets and similarity.

Choose spotters from the discovery brief's "identifiers that appear inside text" list. In the
reference implementation those are: part numbers, functional item numbers, drawing numbers,
harness references, access panels, kit numbers, repair-drawing references, and **the document
identifier of every record type** — that last group is what makes "this bulletin names that
maintenance task" a link rather than a coincidence.

---

## 3. Linking rules — the field-level decision

One rule per **(entity type × data node type × data field)**, stored as one file per (data node
type, field) holding all its rules (`nlp/linking/index-linking.<Type>.<Field>.json`). That
combinatorial shape is the point: you are choosing, per text field, which vocabularies are worth
resolving in it.

The **entity type is `<NodeType>.<FieldName>`** of the spotter that finds it (`PartNumber.Pn`),
not the spotter's display name. **Keep the workspace's own rules in every file** — the
`_Abbreviation` pair and the `_Contact` / `_Organization` rules the export lists: the import
replaces a field's whole rule set, and dropping the built-ins fails it with `Linking for
_Abbreviation needs to be removed …`. Generate the files by appending your rules to an exported
one.

```json
{
  "EntityType":      "PartNumber.Pn",
  "EntityNodeType":  "PartNumber",
  "EdgeTypeToEntity":"_Mentions",
  "EdgeTypeToNode":  "_AppearsIn",
  "DataNodeType":    "Modification",
  "DataNodeField":   "Abstract",
  "IgnoreCase":      false,
  "AddIfNotFound":   false
}
```

Guidance:

- **Every prose field of every record type gets the full set of rules**, unless you have a
  reason not to. Under-linking is the common failure: an impact that lives in the effects
  paragraph and nowhere else simply never surfaces. The reference implementation runs the
  same ~18 entity types against every text field of every record type and revision type —
  several hundred rules, generated rather than hand-written.
- **Include the record-identifier spotters of every other record type.** Cross-references
  written in prose are the highest-signal mentions in the corpus.
- **`IgnoreCase: false` for structured identifiers**, `true` for names, organisations,
  abbreviations. A case-insensitive identifier match produces false positives against ordinary
  words.
- **Do not link the field the entity was built from to itself.** A part number's own
  `Pn` field mentioning part numbers is noise.
- **Abbreviations and contacts/organisations come for free** — the built-in entity types are
  worth adding to prose fields; they cost nothing and make an answer's vocabulary navigable.
- The **file-content** node type deserves rules too where documents are attached: that is how a
  mention inside the published PDF becomes an edge.

---

## 4. Pipelines

A pipeline (`_NlpPipeline`) is an ordered list of **model UIDs**, per language, that text is
parsed through: the workspace's built-in tokenizer, sentence detector and part-of-speech models
first (the same UIDs on every workspace — copy them from the head of the exported
`MosaikGraph-DataParsing-EN`), then your spotters. A pipeline of spotters only has no tokenizer,
so nothing is ever spotted; a spotter that is not in a pipeline never runs.

**Entity linking only runs for fields mapped to the pipeline that carries the spotters.**
`config/pipeline-mapping.json` holds one `Type: 0` (`ForNodeTypeAndField`) entry per parsed field
— every field with an `index-parser` (`FieldToDocumentIndex`) file — naming that pipeline's UID:

```json
{ "Type": 0, "NodeType": "Change", "FieldName": "EffectsText", "Language": "--", "UID": "<spotter pipeline uid>" }
```

`Type: 1` / `Type: 2` are the search-box and file defaults, per language, and their UIDs are
per workspace — keep the target workspace's own. `Language` is ignored on a `Type: 0` entry (the
export writes `"ab"`). The import **replaces the whole mapping**, so start from the workspace's
export and add to it; generate it from the parser-index files so a new field cannot be left out.
Most of the demos deployed to 26.10 first shipped with **zero `_Mentions` edges** because no
field was mapped — and nothing reports it.

**On a workspace that is already ingested, a new mapping changes nothing until the parser
indexes are rebuilt:**

```bash
api "index/list/FieldToDocumentIndex"                          # every parser index: NodeType + UID
api "index/recreate?nodeType=<Type>&indexUID=<uid>" -X POST    # for each of them
api "index/status/any"                                         # poll until false
api "node/<a record whose prose names an identifier>/andedges" # _Mentions edges are there
```

The same pipeline UID goes to the front end: a chat view parses assistant replies against it
so that identifiers in an answer become links to the records they name (`ParseAs`, see
`curiosity-chat-experience`). The language-neutral pipeline, or a search-query one, links
nothing.

**Checklist when a mention is not appearing** — walk it in this order:

1. Is the **field indexed** at all — is there an `index-parser` file for it?
2. Is the field **mapped to the pipeline with the spotters** in `pipeline-mapping.json`?
3. Does a **spotter** exist for that (node type, field), and is it **in that pipeline**, after
   the built-in tokenizer models?
4. Is there a **linking rule** for this (entity, data node type, data field) triple?
5. Does `MinimumLength` / `IgnoreNumbers` exclude this particular value?
6. Have the **nodes been ingested** — a spotter built before the catalogue exists has nothing
   in it, and needs rebuilding.
7. Were the **parser indexes recreated** after the mapping changed, and has the background
   linking finished (`index/status/any` false)? It is asynchronous and lags a large ingest.

## 5. Text indexes — what is searchable and embeddable

An index is declared per (node type, field). The settings that matter in practice:

| Setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Searchable` | the field participates in full-text search |
| `SearchBoostFactor` | relative weight — raise for titles and identifiers, leave at 1 for body prose |
| `ProducesFacets` | the field becomes a **property facet** — string, enum or time. It filters *this node type only*, so it is right for a dimension one type carries alone; for anything more than one type carries, prefer a **graph facet** (node + edge), which filters them all at once. See `curiosity-graph-modelling` §1 |
| `IndexLemma`, `IndexAliases`, `IndexStopWords` | linguistic normalisation |
| `Fuzziness` | typo tolerance; leave at the default for identifiers |
| `Language` | `Any` for a mixed or identifier-heavy corpus |
| `Mode` | when indexing happens relative to node availability |
| `EnableAISearch` (embedding indexes) | **`true` on every sentence-embedding index.** Text-similarity search without an explicit index reads only AI-search-enabled indexes; with it off, every similarity text signal is silently empty |
| `ChunkText` (embedding indexes) | off for fields shorter than one chunk (2,048 characters by default): a chunked index stores no per-node vector, so a field-to-field similarity has nothing to seed from |

Rules:

- **Index each prose section as its own field**, not concatenated. That is why the connector
  flattens source sections into one property each: it lets you boost a title over a body, and
  it lets a similarity signal read a specific section.
- **Index the identifier fields**, with a boost. Users search by identifier constantly.
- **Do not index bookkeeping.** Every index costs build time and memory.
- **Index the revision types too** if users search history — and accept that it roughly
  doubles the index count.

## 6. What this layer is for — and how to keep it honest

The application's claim is that it finds connections nobody catalogued. That claim is only
testable if:

- the corpus contains pairs that are **related and share no vocabulary**, discoverable only
  by a shared entity;
- and pairs that **share no entity at all**, discoverable only by text similarity;
- and the ground truth records **which mechanism** was supposed to find each one.

If your corpus is synthetic, plant both kinds deliberately and label them. If it is real, get
the customer to label ten cases during discovery (`curiosity-use-case-discovery` round 6).
Without that labelling you cannot tell a working entity layer from a coincidence.
