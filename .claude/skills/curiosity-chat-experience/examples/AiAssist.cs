// Reference template: handing a question to the assistant with its evidence attached.
// See ../SKILL.md §5.
//
// This is the highest-value AI entry point in the application — higher than the chat page. Both
// AI buttons in this front end are the same three steps (open a chat on the assistant, attach
// the nodes the question is about, post the question) and THE VALUE IS ENTIRELY IN STEP TWO.
//
// A question typed into a bare chat makes the assistant go looking for records by name; the
// same question with the records IN CONTEXT lets it consult them by id — which is the
// difference between an answer about these records and an answer about records with similar
// titles.
