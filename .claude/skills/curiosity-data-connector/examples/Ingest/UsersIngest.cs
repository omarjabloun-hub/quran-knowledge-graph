// The user node type is OWNED BY THE GRAPH, so it is not a [Node] class here and there is
// nowhere to put properties on it. Everything you want to know about a person is therefore an
// EDGE to the same nodes your records are classified by — which is what puts someone one hop
// from the work of their own office, and what lets a screen render a profile from UIDs (each
// one opening that site, that department, that speciality) instead of from strings an endpoint
// had to spell out.
